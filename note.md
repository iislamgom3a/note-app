# **AI-generated Content** 

AI-generated content is any piece of written, audio, or visual media that was created partially or completely by an artificial intelligence-powered tool. 

If someone uses AI to create something, it doesn’t automatically mean they cheated or irresponsibly cut corners. AI is often a great place to start when creating outlines, compiling thought-starters, or seeking a new way of looking at a problem.  

## **AI Hallucination** 

When your question stumps an AI, it doesn’t always admit that it doesn’t know the answer. So, instead of not giving an answer, it’ll make one up that it thinks you want to hear. This made-up answer is known as an AI hallucination. 

One real-world case of a costly AI hallucination occurred in New York where a [lawyer used ChatGPT to write a brief](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html). The brief seemed complete and cited its sources, but it turns out that none of the sources existed. It was all a figment of the AI’s “imagination.”  

## **Black Box** 

To understand the term black box, imagine the AI as a system of cogs, pulleys, and conveyor belts housed within a box. In a see-through box, you can see how the input is transformed into the final product; however, some AIs are referred to as a black box. That means you don’t know how the AI arrived at its conclusions. The AI completely hides its reasoning process. A black box can be a problem if you’d like to double-check the AI’s work.
